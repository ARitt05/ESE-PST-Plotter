# ESE-PST-Plotter

Plotting tool used to view instances of ESE and PST in a 5 qubit spin-chain. 

## How it Works

User choses eigenvalues X and Y such that:
- X>Y
- X is even
- Y is odd

Selected eigenvalues are used to plot the time evolution of quantum states.

## How to install

Download 'ESEAppInstaller.exe' and follow prompts. 
Once installed, open the file and plot different cases to observe ESE and PST!
