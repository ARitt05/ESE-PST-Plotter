# ESE-PST-Plotter

Plotting tool used to view instances of ESE and PST in a 5-qubit spin-chain. 

## How it Works

User chooses eigenvalues X and Y such that:
- X>Y
- X is even
- Y is odd

Selected eigenvalues are used to plot the time evolution of quantum states.

## How to install 
Ensure that a MATLAB_Runtime matching R2025a is installed on your device.

Download 'ESEAppInstaller.exe' and follow prompts. 

Once installed, open the file and plot different cases to observe ESE and PST!
